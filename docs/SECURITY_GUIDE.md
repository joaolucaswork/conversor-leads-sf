# üîí SECURITY GUIDE - LEADS PROCESSING SYSTEM

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

During the security audit of your leads processing project, several critical issues were identified that **MUST** be addressed before making the repository public:

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **üî• EXPOSED OPENAI API KEY** - Found in `config/.env`
2. **üìä CONFIDENTIAL LEAD DATA** - Multiple Excel/CSV files with customer information
3. **üìù SENSITIVE LOGS** - Processing logs containing lead data and API responses
4. **üíæ CACHED DATA** - AI mappings and processing cache with sensitive information

## üìã SECURITY CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive security patterns
- [x] Added protection for API keys, credentials, and tokens
- [x] Excluded all lead data files (Excel/CSV)
- [x] Protected log files and cache directories
- [x] Added safeguards for temporary and backup files

### üîÑ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

#### 1. **SECURE THE OPENAI API KEY**

```bash
# CRITICAL: Your OpenAI API key is exposed in config/.env
# This key should be regenerated immediately!

# Steps:
# 1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 3. Generate a new API key
# 4. Update your local config/.env file with the new key
# 5. NEVER commit the config/.env file to git
```

#### 2. **REMOVE SENSITIVE FILES FROM GIT HISTORY**

```bash
# Check if sensitive files are tracked in git
git ls-files | grep -E "\.(csv|xlsx|xls|log)$"

# If any sensitive files are found, remove them from git history
git rm --cached config/.env
git rm --cached "data/input/*.csv"
git rm --cached "data/output/*.csv"
git rm --cached "*.log"

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove sensitive files from tracking"
```

#### 3. **CLEAN UP EXISTING SENSITIVE DATA**

```bash
# Use the built-in security cleanup tool
python tools/security_audit_cleanup.py

# Or manually remove sensitive files:
# - Delete all files in data/input/ (except .gitkeep)
# - Delete all files in data/output/ (except .gitkeep)
# - Delete all .log files
# - Delete config/.env (keep .env.example)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. API Keys & Credentials Protection**

- All `.env` files excluded (except examples)
- OAuth tokens and session data protected
- API configuration files secured
- Credential storage files blocked

### **2. Lead Data Protection**

- All Excel/CSV files excluded by default
- Data directories completely protected
- Processing results and summaries blocked
- Lead assignment files secured

### **3. Log File Security**

- All log files excluded (may contain sensitive data)
- Processing logs with lead information protected
- Debug and error logs secured
- API response logs blocked

### **4. Cache & Temporary File Protection**

- AI processing cache excluded
- Temporary processing files blocked
- Upload and conversion temp files protected
- Backup files secured

## üìÅ SAFE FILES TO COMMIT

The enhanced .gitignore allows these safe files:

- Source code (.js, .jsx, .py)
- Configuration templates and examples
- Documentation files
- Test files with sample data
- Package configuration files
- Build and deployment scripts

## üö´ NEVER COMMIT THESE FILES

- **Real lead data** (Excel/CSV with customer info)
- **API keys or credentials** (.env files with secrets)
- **Processing logs** (may contain sensitive data)
- **OAuth tokens** (authentication data)
- **Cache files** (may contain lead mappings)
- **Backup files** (may contain sensitive data)
- **Debug files** (may expose internal data)

## üîç VERIFICATION STEPS

Before making the repository public:

1. **Run Security Audit:**

   ```bash
   python tools/security_audit_cleanup.py
   ```

2. **Check Git Status:**

   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show no sensitive files
   ```

3. **Verify .gitignore:**

   ```bash
   git check-ignore config/.env
   git check-ignore data/input/test.csv
   git check-ignore logs/test.log
   # All should return the file path (meaning they're ignored)
   ```

4. **Test with Sample Data:**
   - Add a test CSV file to data/input/
   - Verify it doesn't appear in `git status`
   - Add a test .env file to config/
   - Verify it doesn't appear in `git status`

## üÜò EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Sensitive Data Was Already Committed

1. **Remove from Git History:**

   ```bash
   # For specific files
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch config/.env' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

   # For all CSV files
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch *.csv' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Force Push (DANGEROUS - only if repository is private):**

   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

3. **Regenerate All Compromised Credentials:**
   - OpenAI API keys
   - Salesforce OAuth credentials
   - Any other exposed secrets

## üìû SUPPORT

If you need help with any security issues:

1. Check the security audit tool output
2. Review this guide carefully
3. Test with sample data before going public
4. Consider a security review before public release

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL WARNING

**DO NOT** make this repository public until:

- [ ] OpenAI API key is regenerated and secured
- [ ] All lead data files are removed
- [ ] All log files are cleaned
- [ ] Security audit passes
- [ ] .gitignore is tested and verified

Your business reputation and customer data security depend on following these steps carefully.
