# Atribuir Column Mapping and Assignment Preservation Fix

## Issue Resolved

### **Problem**: "Atribuir" Column Not Mapped and Assignments Overridden
The AI-enhanced leads processor had two critical issues:

1. **Mapping Issue**: The "Atribuir" column from the Excel file was being marked as "UNMAPPED"
2. **Assignment Override**: The system was applying automatic lead distribution rules instead of preserving the original assignment values from the spreadsheet

### **Impact**: 
- Original lead assignments (gustlima: 50, esouza: 50, rtavares: 50, pmarques: 50) were being replaced with system defaults (guic: 100, cmilfont: 100)
- Loss of existing business logic and lead distribution from the source data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **✅ Added "Atribuir" → "OwnerId" Mapping Rule**

**File**: `core/ai_field_mapper.py`

**Before**:
```python
# Owner fields
r'alias|owner|respons[aá]vel|vendedor': 'OwnerId',
```

**After**:
```python
# Owner fields  
r'alias|owner|respons[aá]vel|vendedor|atribuir': 'OwnerId',
```

**Result**: "Atribuir" column now correctly maps to "OwnerId" with 85% confidence

### 2. **✅ Implemented Smart Lead Distribution Logic**

**File**: `core/master_leads_processor_ai.py`

**Before**: Always applied automatic distribution regardless of existing assignments

**After**: Smart logic that preserves original assignments when they exist

```python
def distribute_leads(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Smart lead distribution that preserves original assignments when available.
    Only applies automatic distribution to empty/missing OwnerId values.
    """
    df_distributed = df.copy()
    
    # Check if OwnerId column has existing assignments
    if 'OwnerId' in df_distributed.columns:
        # Count existing assignments
        existing_assignments = df_distributed['OwnerId'].dropna()
        existing_assignments = existing_assignments[existing_assignments.astype(str).str.strip() != '']
        
        if len(existing_assignments) > 0:
            self.logger.info(f"Found {len(existing_assignments)} existing lead assignments - preserving original values")
            
            # Clean up and preserve existing assignments
            # ... (preservation logic)
            
            return df_distributed
    
    # If no existing assignments found, apply automatic distribution
    # ... (automatic distribution logic)
```

### 3. **✅ Enhanced AI Prompt Patterns**

Updated the AI mapping prompt to include "Atribuir" in the owner field patterns:

```
- Alias/Owner/Atribuir → OwnerId
```

## Test Results

### **Complete Mapping Success**: 9/9 columns (100%)

| Input Column (Excel) | Output Column (CSV) | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Lead | Last Name | ✅ MAPPED |
| Tel. Fixo | Phone | ✅ MAPPED |
| Celular | Telefone Adcional | ✅ MAPPED |
| E-mail | Email | ✅ MAPPED |
| Descrição | Description | ✅ MAPPED |
| Volume Aproximado | Patrimônio Financeiro | ✅ MAPPED |
| Tipo | Tipo | ✅ MAPPED |
| Estado | State/Province | ✅ MAPPED |
| **Atribuir** | **OwnerId** | ✅ **MAPPED** |

### **Assignment Preservation Verification**

**Original Assignments (Excel "Atribuir" column)**:
- gustlima: 50 leads
- esouza: 50 leads  
- rtavares: 50 leads
- pmarques: 50 leads

**Final Assignments (CSV "OwnerId" column)**:
- gustlima: 50 leads ✅ (preserved)
- esouza: 50 leads ✅ (preserved)
- rtavares: 50 leads ✅ (preserved)  
- pmarques: 50 leads ✅ (preserved)

**Preservation Rate**: 100% - All original assignments perfectly preserved

## System Behavior

### **When Original Assignments Exist** (Current Excel file):
1. ✅ Maps "Atribuir" → "OwnerId"
2. ✅ Detects existing assignments in OwnerId column
3. ✅ Preserves all original values
4. ✅ Logs: "Found 200 existing lead assignments - preserving original values"
5. ✅ No automatic distribution applied

### **When No Assignments Exist** (Empty or missing OwnerId):
1. ✅ Detects no existing assignments
2. ✅ Applies automatic distribution rules
3. ✅ Logs: "No existing lead assignments found - applying automatic distribution"
4. ✅ Uses configured distribution (guic: 100, cmilfont: 100, etc.)

## Comprehensive Test Suite

**All 4 tests passed (100% success rate)**:

1. **✅ Atribuir Mapping**: Verified "Atribuir" → "OwnerId" mapping works
2. **✅ Complete Excel Mapping**: Confirmed all 9 columns map correctly  
3. **✅ Assignment Preservation**: Verified original assignments are preserved
4. **✅ Full Processing**: End-to-end pipeline test with assignment preservation

## Usage

The fixes are now active. Process your Excel file with:

```bash
# Using quick start (recommended)
python quick_start.py ai data/input/leads_vinteseismaio.xlsx

# Direct command
python core/master_leads_processor_ai.py data/input/leads_vinteseismaio.xlsx
```

## Expected Output

The processed CSV file will now contain:

### **Preserved Original Assignments**:
- **OwnerId**: Original values from "Atribuir" column (gustlima, esouza, rtavares, pmarques)
- **Distribution**: Exactly as specified in the Excel file (50 leads each)

### **All Other Fields Correctly Mapped**:
- ✅ **Last Name**: Customer names from "Lead" column
- ✅ **Description**: Descriptions from "Descrição" column  
- ✅ **Phone**: Primary phone from "Tel. Fixo"
- ✅ **Telefone Adcional**: Secondary phone from "Celular"
- ✅ **Email**: Email addresses from "E-mail"
- ✅ **State/Province**: States from "Estado"
- ✅ **Patrimônio Financeiro**: Financial data from "Volume Aproximado"

## Key Benefits

1. **✅ Respects Business Logic**: Preserves existing lead assignments from source data
2. **✅ No Data Loss**: All original assignment information is maintained
3. **✅ Flexible Behavior**: Automatically detects when to preserve vs. when to distribute
4. **✅ Complete Mapping**: All Excel columns now properly mapped (100% success rate)
5. **✅ Backward Compatible**: Still applies automatic distribution when no assignments exist

## Logging Output

When processing files with existing assignments, you'll see:

```
INFO - Found 200 existing lead assignments - preserving original values
INFO - Preserved lead distribution from original file:
INFO -   gustlima: 50 leads
INFO -   esouza: 50 leads  
INFO -   rtavares: 50 leads
INFO -   pmarques: 50 leads
```
