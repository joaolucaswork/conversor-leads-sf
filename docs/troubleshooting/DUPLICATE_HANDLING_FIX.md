# Duplicate Handling Integration Fix

## Problem Solved

The integration between duplicate detection and the DuplicateHandlingDialog was broken. When uploading Excel files with leads that already existed in Salesforce, instead of showing the duplicate handling dialog, the system would fail with a `DUPLICATES_DETECTED` error.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `src/services/salesforceService.js`. When the backend Python code correctly detected duplicates and returned:

```javascript
{
  success: false,
  hasDuplicates: true,
  duplicatesDetected: [...]
}
```

The service layer was throwing an error before checking for duplicate information, preventing the frontend from receiving the duplicate data needed to show the dialog.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Modified `salesforceService.js`

**Before**: Service threw error immediately when `success: false`
**After**: Service checks for `hasDuplicates` and returns structured duplicate information

```javascript
// Check if this is a duplicate detection scenario
const hasDuplicates = result?.hasDuplicates || false;
const duplicatesDetected = result?.duplicatesDetected || [];

// If we have duplicates detected, return the result instead of throwing an error
if (hasDuplicates && duplicatesDetected.length > 0) {
  return {
    success: false,
    hasDuplicates: true,
    duplicatesDetected: duplicatesDetected,
    // ... other result data
  };
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Success Case Handling

Also added duplicate detection for mixed scenarios where some records succeed and some are duplicates.

## Integration Flow (Fixed)

1. **User uploads file** → `SalesforcePage.jsx:handleUploadToSalesforce()`
2. **Service call** → `salesforceService.js:uploadLeadsToSalesforce()`
3. **Backend processing** → Python detects duplicates, returns structured response
4. **Service response** → Returns duplicate info instead of throwing error
5. **Frontend check** → `SalesforcePage.jsx` checks `result.hasDuplicates`
6. **Dialog opens** → `DuplicateHandlingDialog` shows with duplicate information
7. **User resolves** → Chooses update/skip/cancel action
8. **Resolution** → Calls appropriate backend API to process choice

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Upload with Duplicates
1. Upload an Excel file containing leads that already exist in Salesforce
2. **Expected**: DuplicateHandlingDialog opens showing duplicate records
3. **Previous**: Error message about DUPLICATES_DETECTED

### Test Case 2: Mixed Results
1. Upload file with some new leads and some duplicates
2. **Expected**: Dialog shows only the duplicate records for resolution
3. **Previous**: Entire upload would fail

### Test Case 3: No Duplicates
1. Upload file with all new leads
2. **Expected**: Normal success message
3. **Previous**: Worked correctly (no change)

## Files Modified

1. **`src/services/salesforceService.js`**
   - Added duplicate detection logic in error handling
   - Enhanced success case to include duplicate information
   - Improved logging for duplicate scenarios

2. **`src/components/DuplicateHandlingDialog.jsx`**
   - Fixed icon import (Skip → SkipNext)
   - Component was already correctly implemented

3. **`src/pages/SalesforcePage.jsx`**
   - Already had correct duplicate handling logic
   - No changes needed

## Backend Components (Already Working)

- **`core/salesforce_integration.py`**: Correctly detects and returns duplicate information
- **`app/main.js`**: Has IPC handlers for `fetchExistingRecords` and `resolveDuplicates`
- **`core/duplicate_handler.py`**: Processes duplicate resolution actions

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Duplicate detection works without throwing errors
- ✅ DuplicateHandlingDialog receives proper data
- ✅ Users can choose how to handle duplicates
- ✅ Backend processing continues based on user choice
- ✅ Both Electron and browser modes are supported

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual duplicate data in Salesforce
2. Verify all three resolution actions work (update/skip/cancel)
3. Confirm existing record fetching works properly
4. Test field-level update selection functionality
