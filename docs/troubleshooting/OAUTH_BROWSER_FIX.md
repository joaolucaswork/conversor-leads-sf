# OAuth Browser Authentication Fix

## Problem Summary

The OAuth authentication flow in the browser environment was failing with the error:
```
OAuth token exchange failed: {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"unexpected code verifier"}
```

Additionally, after successful authentication, users needed to manually refresh the page for the application to work properly, indicating issues with state management.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **PKCE Code Verifier Storage Issues**: The code verifier was not being reliably stored or retrieved from localStorage
2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Limited debugging information made it difficult to identify where the flow was breaking
3. **State Management Problems**: The auth store wasn't being properly updated after successful authentication
4. **Message Passing Issues**: OAuth callback messages weren't being properly handled by the parent window

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced PKCE Code Verifier Management

**File**: `src/utils/environment.js`

- Added comprehensive logging for PKCE generation and storage
- Implemented storage verification to ensure code verifier is properly saved
- Enhanced error handling with detailed debugging information
- Added storage helper methods for better debugging

### 2. Improved OAuth Code Exchange

**File**: `src/utils/environment.js` - `exchangeCodeInBrowser` function

- Added detailed logging throughout the token exchange process
- Enhanced error reporting with specific failure points
- Added verification of storage operations
- Implemented cleanup and recovery mechanisms

### 3. Enhanced OAuth Callback Page

**File**: `src/pages/OAuthCallbackPage.jsx`

- Added comprehensive logging for the callback process
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced message passing to parent windows
- Better state management integration

### 4. Improved Auth Store Browser Support

**File**: `src/store/authStore.js`

- Added browser storage recovery mechanism
- Enhanced OAuth message handling with validation
- Improved error handling for browser-specific scenarios
- Added fallback authentication state recovery

### 5. Enhanced Browser Storage Implementation

**File**: `src/utils/environment.js` - `browserStorage` object

- Added storage verification for set operations
- Enhanced delete operation with verification
- Added helper methods for debugging (listKeys, clear)
- Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Tools

### 1. Debug Tool: `debug-oauth-browser.html`

A comprehensive debugging tool that allows you to:
- Check environment and browser capabilities
- Inspect localStorage contents
- Test OAuth configuration retrieval
- Test PKCE generation and storage
- Run a complete OAuth flow with detailed logging

**Usage**:
1. Open `debug-oauth-browser.html` in your browser
2. Run through the debug steps in order
3. Use the "Start Full OAuth Flow" to test the complete process

### 2. Enhanced Logging

All OAuth-related operations now include detailed console logging with prefixes:
- `Browser OAuth:` - OAuth flow operations
- `OAuth Callback:` - Callback page operations
- `AuthStore:` - Authentication store operations

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Start the Development Environment
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test in Browser Mode
1. Open the application in a browser (not Electron)
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Click "Login with Salesforce"
4. Complete the OAuth flow in the popup
5. Verify that the application automatically updates without requiring a page refresh

### Step 3: Use the Debug Tool (if issues persist)
1. Open `debug-oauth-browser.html` in your browser
2. Run through all debug steps
3. Check the console for detailed error information
4. Use the storage inspection tools to verify PKCE storage

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
Monitor the browser console for detailed logging:
- Look for "Browser OAuth:" messages during the flow
- Check for any error messages or warnings
- Verify that storage operations are successful

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Successful OAuth Flow**: Users should be able to complete OAuth authentication without errors
2. **Automatic State Update**: After successful authentication, the application should automatically update its state without requiring a page refresh
3. **Proper Error Handling**: If errors occur, they should be clearly logged with specific failure points
4. **Reliable Storage**: PKCE code verifiers should be reliably stored and retrieved from localStorage

## Debugging Information

If issues persist, check the following:

### 1. Console Logs
Look for these specific log patterns:
- `Browser OAuth: Starting OAuth URL generation`
- `Browser OAuth: Code verifier stored and verified successfully`
- `Browser OAuth: Starting code exchange for code:`
- `OAuth Callback: Token exchange successful`
- `AuthStore: Processing browser OAuth success message`

### 2. localStorage Contents
Check for these keys in localStorage:
- `electron-store-oauth_code_verifier` (should exist during OAuth flow)
- `electron-store-salesforceAuth` (should exist after successful authentication)
- `electron-store-oauth_last_success` (success tracking)
- `electron-store-oauth_last_error` (error tracking)

### 3. Network Requests
Monitor network requests to:
- `/api/v1/oauth/config` - Should return OAuth configuration
- `/api/v1/oauth/token` - Should successfully exchange code for token

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with the Electron environment
- All changes are focused on the browser environment and don't affect Electron functionality
- The enhanced logging can be reduced in production by modifying the console.log statements
- The debug tool (`debug-oauth-browser.html`) can be removed in production builds

## Recovery Mechanisms

The fix includes several recovery mechanisms:

1. **Storage Verification**: All storage operations are verified to ensure data integrity
2. **Error Tracking**: Failed OAuth attempts are logged for debugging
3. **State Recovery**: The auth store can recover authentication state from localStorage
4. **Cleanup**: Failed OAuth attempts properly clean up partial state

This comprehensive fix should resolve the OAuth authentication issues in the browser environment while providing extensive debugging capabilities for any future issues.
